AJAX

In the template files provided, you are going to create a predictive search feature.

I have created a simple API that you will use ajax to request a json object with search terms. Upon typing a character that one of the words on the list begins with, a function will fire that will begin to display matches as the user continues to type.
This functionality will be similar to when you perform a google search, as you type, google shows you different results as you type
that contain links to take you to the result you choose.


__YOU MAY NOT USE JQUERY AUTOCOMPLETE WIDGET OR ANY OTHER AUTOCOMPLETE METHOD OTHER THAN YOUR OWN__
 
 All of the code for this must be written by you. You are free to use vanilla js, or jQuery to get the job done. The search
 results should be styled to match the existing form aesthetic.
 
 There are a few easter eggs hidden in the api that you can find by messing with the request url, there are some headers you can 
 find in the response object, all kinds of fun things.
 
 The url for the API is http://www.mattbowytz.com/simple_api.json
 You can put a number of query parameters at the end of the url to get different data.
 
 `?data=all`, `?data=interests`, `?data=programming`, `?data=comics`
 
 You can use any of the data to do anything you want for this as well.
 
 ### Bonus Points
 
 Make the autocomplete results into clickable links that will take you to google search results in a new tab.
